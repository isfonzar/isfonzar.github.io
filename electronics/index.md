Electronics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of electrons.

## What is electricity?

Electricity is the flow of [electrons](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) through conductors, like for instance, wires.

The flow of the electrons is called electric current and it's measured in [amperes (A)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere).

6,241,509,629,152,650,000 electrons (or charges) make up for 1 [coulomb (C)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb), the coulomb represents a quantity of electric charge.

1 ampere (A) is equal to 1 coulomb (C) (6.2415 × 10^18 electrons) per second.

## Electric Potential Difference (Voltage)

Voltage or electric potential difference is what makes those electrons move.

Voltage is equal to the current x resistence.
