There are two families of integrated circuits.

## 7400 series

Designed to handle a steady 5V and more difficult to damage.

The first two numbers of an IC represent the family (74-)

Known as transistor-transistor logic (TTL) devices

The last two digits (sometimes three) digits (-00) indicate which IC this is in the family.

- 7400 four two-input NAND gate
- 7402 four two-input NOR gate

## 4000 series
