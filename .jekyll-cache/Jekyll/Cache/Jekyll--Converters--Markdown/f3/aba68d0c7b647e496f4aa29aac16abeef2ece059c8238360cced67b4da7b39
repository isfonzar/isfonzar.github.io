<p><strong>PSR</strong> in PHP stands for <strong>PHP Standard Recommendation</strong> and its purpose is to help standardize some programming concepts in PHP.</p>

<p>Those recommendations are proposed and approved by the <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/">PHP Framework Interop Group</a>, 
a group of several framework developers and founders whose aim is to talk about the commonalities of their projects and 
propose a common basis to work together. The full list of PSRs can be found <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although itâ€™s not mandatory to follow those rules, ideally, following a set of standards allow other developers to easily
understand and work with your code and also makes it easier to integrate with third-party components (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>This can be achieved by following one or more PSRs or other coding standards like <a href="https://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php">PEAR coding standards</a>
for instance.</p>
