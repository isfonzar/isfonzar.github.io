I"Ÿ<p>My name is Icaro Souza Fonzar, Iâ€™m a backend engineer currently based in Berlin, Germany.</p>

<p>I have over 5 years of experience developing high-available and reliable APIs, programming sustainable libraries and architecturing systems and services.</p>

<p>I created this blog as a source of my knowledge and mostly because I feel like I learn better when I â€œpresentâ€ my learnings to someone and also so I can refer to it again in the future.</p>

<p>You can find some of my projects and libraries at <a href="https://github.com/isfonzar">Github</a> 
and more information about me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isfonzar/">Linkedin page</a>.</p>
