I"Ô<p>This is going to be a series of posts on my journey to build an 8-bit computer.</p>

<p>The reason why I decided to build an 8-bit computer from scratch is because I thought it would be a great project to refresh up my electronics skills and learn some new ones.</p>

<p>For this, I am using <a href="https://eater.net/8bit">Ben Eater</a>â€™s project as the main reference for my computer.</p>

<p>I started by buying a simple electronic kits from Elegoo from <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B01M7N4WB6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;language=en_GB&amp;psc=1">Amazon</a>. After a bit of search, I found out this would give me the most value for my money, as it already came with a Breadboard and a lot of components I would be using later on.</p>

<p>The clock synchronizes all of the components in our computer and itâ€™s the first component Iâ€™ve built.</p>
