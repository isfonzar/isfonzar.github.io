# Cryptography

The word `cryptography` is derived from 2 greek words: _`kryptós`_ meaning "secret" or "hidden" and _`graphein`_ which means "writings".

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication. The objectives of Cryptography are:

- Privacy: Ensuring that data that is private remains private.

- Authentication: Cryptography helps us confirm that individuals are who they say they are.

- Integrity: Cryptography helps us assure that the data has not been modified by a third-party.

- Non-repudiation: Both the sender and the receiver can be sure of that status of the other one in a transaction.
