My name is Icaro Souza Fonzar, I'm a backend engineer currently based in Berlin, Germany. 

I have over 5 years of experience developing high-available and reliable APIs, programming sustainable libraries and architecturing systems and services.

I created this blog as a source of my knowledge and mostly because I feel like I learn better when I "present" my learnings to someone and also so I can refer to it again in the future.

You can find some of my projects and libraries at [Github][isfonzar-github] 
and more information about me on my [Linkedin page][isfonzar-linkedin].
