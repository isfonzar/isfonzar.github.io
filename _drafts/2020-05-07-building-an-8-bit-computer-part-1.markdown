This is going to be a series of posts on my journey to build an 8-bit computer. 

The reason why I decided to build an 8-bit computer from scratch is because I thought it would be a great project to refresh up my electronics skills and learn some new ones.

For this, I am using [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/8bit)'s project as the main reference for my computer.

I started by buying a simple electronic kits from Elegoo from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B01M7N4WB6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&language=en_GB&psc=1). After a bit of search, I found out this would give me the most value for my money, as it already came with a Breadboard and a lot of components I would be using later on.

I also bought some 555 integrated circuits (chip). The 555 timer IC. The datasheet for the purchased 555 can be found [here](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/se555m.pdf?HQS=TI-null-null-alldatasheets-df-pf-SEP-wwe).

## Building the Clock module

The clock synchronizes all of the components in our computer and it's the first component I've built.
