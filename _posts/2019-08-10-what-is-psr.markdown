# Understanding PSR in PHP

**PSR** in PHP stands for **PHP Standard Recommendation** and its purpose is to help standardize some programming concepts in PHP.

Those recommendations are proposed and approved by the [PHP Framework Interop Group](https://www.php-fig.org/), 
a group of several framework developers and founders whose aim is to talk about the commonalities of their projects and 
propose a common basis to work together. The full list of PSRs can be found [here](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/).

Although it's not mandatory to follow those rules, ideally, following a set of standards allow other developers to easily
understand and work with your code and also makes it easier to integrate with third-party components (and vice-versa).

This can be achieved by following one or more PSRs or other coding standards like [PEAR coding standards](https://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php)
for instance.
