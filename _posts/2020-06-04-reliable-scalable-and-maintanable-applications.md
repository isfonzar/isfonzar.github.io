There are many factors that influence the design of an application, however there are three qualitites that are important in most software systems: reliability, scalability and maintainability. In this post, I'm going to review those attributes and give a brief overview of what each one of them means.

## Reliability

Reliability is the concern that an application will perform its intended functions satisfactoryly, even when faults or errors occur.

[Netflix's Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey) randomly terminates instances with the purpose of discovering faults and guarantee that their services are resilients to failures.



## Scalability

## Maintainability


## Conclusion

Designing reliable, scalable and maintanable applications is one of the main goals of software engineering.
